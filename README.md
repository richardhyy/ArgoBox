## Notice

Web server listens on the hard-coded address which is `0.0.0.0:8080`, and database connection information is also written directly into the sourcecode. This is bogus, but since I did not have enough time during the end-term exam weeks, this temporary solution was implemented. For this reason, if you are attempting to run ArgoBox on your local machine, you may need to adjust these settings in the sourcecode.
